# Password Generator

### Make your passwords more secure than ever!

With our new password generator app, you'll have the ability to create randomized passwords by inputting your password specifications. Need a password including capitol letters? Special Characters? We've got you covered!

## Usage and Features

// loop
This is how the app appears to users. It is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes.

<p align="center">
<img alt="Screenshot of the homepage, showing a box where the generated password will appear and a button below it." src="./dist/images/homepage.jpg"/>
</p>    
// end loop

## Suggestion Box

In the future, I would like to add the following improvements:

// loop
- The user will have the option to customize which special characters they would like to include in the password generator.
// end loop

I'm always interested in refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach our development team at the links below.
